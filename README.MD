Make sure .env file exists in the main folder containing environments mentioned below:

```KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS = 'localhost:9093'
KAFKA_TOPIC_PIZZA = 'pizza_events'
KAFKA_TOPIC_CHECKOUT = 'checkout_events'
KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP = '1'

POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgrespass
POSTGRES_PORT=5433
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_DB=postgres

MONGO_USERNAME=user
MONGO_PASSWORD=pass
MONGO_HOST=localhost
MONGO_PORT=27017```

You can use your own creds.

Create .streamlit folder containing secrets.toml file which should have mongo creds:

```[mongo]
host = "localhost"
port = 27017
username = "user"
password = "pass"```

To start the system just run start.sh on linux
